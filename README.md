# Fullstack Web Application with JWT Authentication

A fullstack web application featuring user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

> Backend: Developed entirely by me using Java Spring Framework, implementing robust JWT-based authentication and database integration.

> Frontend: Created with assistance from AI tools and some manual adjustments. It securely stores the JWT token and includes it in headers for every authenticated request.

Status: Core functionality is complete. I will improve the securty and code by the time
